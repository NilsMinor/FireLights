#FireLights 
###### A wireless mesh netowrk for battery powerd lights

This project is based on fruitymesh, a bluetooth low energy mesh based on direct connections. It is used as firmware for custom
light nodes. The implementation is work in progress and uses the branch **firelight**

More information on fruitymesh can be found in the https://www.bluerange.io/docs/bluerange-firmware/index.html[fruitymesh documentation]

This implementation uses custom modules, custom board config and messages. The firmware also implements PWM controlling for dimming LEDs.
